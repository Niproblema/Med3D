File names are structured according to these guidelines:

 * Vertex shaders end with '.vert'
 * Fragment shaders end with '.frag'
 * Files containing information about shaders and their inputs/outputs end with '.shader'
 * File names begin with 'gl_' or 'gl2_' if using WebGL 1.x or Webgl 2.x, respectively
