Add alpha fix for background from pTest, move VPTobject to transparent objects in pipeline, but keep transparent flag off in material setup?
VPT should have same camera near clipping as mesh renderer.


Maybe:
 -Second subscriber rejoin - duplicate shared cameras on host.
 -Context Lost?
 -Store only 1 MCC geometry - memory issue. On making new one, old one is still in memory until new one loads.
 -How to synchronize MCC geometry?
 -choose to share VPT settings or nah


Rethink: 
 -Mip background off maybe broken
 -Geometry export locks UI and MCC indices export maybe wrong + Cancel on geometry export
