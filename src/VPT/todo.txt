Shared session with shared VPT parameters + gc in shared session
How to synchronize MCC geometry?



Maybe:
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw. Move vptInterface further up in MainPass
 -Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?
 -blend VPT renderers
 -Second subscriber rejoin - duplicate shared cameras on host.
 -MCS EnvironmentMap when MCC is projected 
 -UI update in vptBundle


Rethink: 
 -Mip background off maybe broken
 -Geometry export locks UI and MCC indices export maybe wrong + Cancel on geometry export
 -Limit number of UI updates/s and merge them into one.
