Raytrace annotations,
merge phong and VPT with slider
Shared session with shared VPT parameters, Marching cubes geometry. VPT data to binary blob
Iso value?
Environment map UI option - Za celo sceno, al za VPT only?
UI accordion, fix css defualt pick
VPT gc in shared session
remove OFF renderer from selection, remove phong material.


Maybe:
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw. Move vptInterface further up in MainPass
 -Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?

Rethink:
 -M3D group of meshes vs single large mesh.
 -Export to obj - too many vertexes.
 -M3D import obj, duplicate vertexes that share faces.
 -M3D phong 
 -Material transparent ? some alpha artifacting : probably issue with multiple objects (without mcc)
