VPT issue - BostonTeapot at twice the width
Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?
VTP render res UI setting
parse scene cameras and replicate to VPT for 
UI accordion, fix css defualt pick
MCC Compute btn ng-disable does not enable itself when object loaded with collaboration.


Maybe:
 -Angle issues - VPT shaders can't compile - undefined loop (at compile) in EAM render.frag
 	-MCS crash graphic driver(nvidia)
        -Artifacting with ISO, MIP in chrome, but not mozilla - maybe due to TriangleFans deprecated in dx10+
 -update bootstrap + alpha v colorpickerju
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw.

Rethink:
 -offscreeen canvas - advantage: non shared GL settings
 -Reinhard tonemapper + Range tonemapper
 -VPT gc in shared session
