Shared session with shared VPT parameters + gc in shared session
How to synchronize MCC geometry?



Maybe:
 -Second subscriber rejoin - duplicate shared cameras on host.
 -Context Lost?


Rethink: 
 -Mip background off maybe broken
 -Geometry export locks UI and MCC indices export maybe wrong + Cancel on geometry export
 -Limit number of UI updates/s and merge them into one.
