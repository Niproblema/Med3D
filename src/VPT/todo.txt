Shared session with shared VPT parameters + gc in shared session
MCC import + fix vertex parsing
streamsaver offline



Maybe:
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw. Move vptInterface further up in MainPass
 -Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?
 -blend VPT renderers
 -Second subscriber rejoin - duplicate shared cameras on host.
 -MCS EnvironmentMap when MCC is projected
 -Don't block UI thread when exporting MCC

Rethink: 
 -Mip background off maybe broken
 -Geometry export locks UI and still broken
