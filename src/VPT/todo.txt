Move reset VPT to nGS model, don't trigger on refresh UI, don't trigger on same settings


Maybe:
 -Second subscriber rejoin - duplicate shared cameras on host.
 -Context Lost?
 -Store less MCC geometry copies - memory issue
 -How to synchronize MCC geometry?
 -choose to share VPT settings or nah


Rethink: 
 -Mip background off maybe broken
 -Geometry export locks UI and MCC indices export maybe wrong + Cancel on geometry export
 -Limit number of UI updates/s and merge them into one.
 -Decrease update amount.
