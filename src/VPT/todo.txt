Shared session with shared VPT parameters
VPT gc in shared session
MCC import/export geo fix
Mesh diffuse color
Limit na obj vertex # export + fix objLoader for import
MCS EnvironmentMap when MCC is projected


Maybe:
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw. Move vptInterface further up in MainPass
 -Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?
 -blend VPT renderers

Rethink: 
 -Homogeneous coordinate manual division ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24441631/how-exactly-does-opengl-do-perspectively-correct-linear-interpolation
