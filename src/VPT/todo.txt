Shared session with shared VPT parameters
VPT gc in shared session
MCC import/export geo fix


Maybe:
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw. Move vptInterface further up in MainPass
 -Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?

Rethink:
 -M3D group of meshes vs single large mesh.
 -Export to obj - too many vertexes.
 -M3D import obj, duplicate vertexes that share faces.
 -Material transparent ? some alpha artifacting : probably issue with multiple objects (without mcc)
 -Homogeneous coordinate manual division ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24441631/how-exactly-does-opengl-do-perspectively-correct-linear-interpolation
 -Environment map UI option - Za celo sceno, al za VPT only?
