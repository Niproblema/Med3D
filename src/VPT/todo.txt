VPT issue - BostonTeapot at twice the width

Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?
VTP render res UI setting
vpt frame background settings

volume sharing session.
parse scene cameras and replicate to VPT for 
UI accordion, fix css defualt pick


Maybe:
 -Reuse VPT renderers instead of copies in /src/VPT/v_renderers.	-Maybe extend?
 -File loading menu, server files don't work
 -Angle issues - VPT shaders can't compile - undefined loop (at compile) in EAM render.frag
 	-MCS crash graphic driver(nvidia)
        -Artifacting with ISO, MIP in chrome, but not mozilla - maybe due to TriangleFans deprecated in dx10+
 -update bootstrap + alpha v colorpickerju
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw.

Rethink:
 -MCS 
 -offscreeen canvas - advantage: non shared GL settings
 -Reinhard tonemapper
 -Range tonemapper


Consult :
