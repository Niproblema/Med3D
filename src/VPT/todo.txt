Export MCC to .obj and import
Raytrace annotations,
Shared session with shared VPT parameters, Marching cubes geometry
Iso value?

merge phong and VPT with slider
VPT resolution buffer slider
Environment map UI option - Za celo sceno, al za VPT only?



VPT issue - BostonTeapot at twice the width
Move vptInterface into it's own render pass?
VTP render res UI setting
parse scene lights and replicate to VPT for 
UI accordion, fix css defualt pick
MCC Compute btn ng-disable does not enable itself when object loaded with collaboration.


Maybe:
 -Angle issues - VPT shaders can't compile - undefined loop (at compile) in EAM render.frag
 	-MCS crash graphic driver(nvidia)
        -Artifacting with ISO, MIP in chrome, but not mozilla - maybe due to TriangleFans deprecated in dx10+
 -update bootstrap + alpha v colorpickerju
 -VPT geometry switch causes GL drawArrays error in first draw.

Rethink:
 -offscreeen canvas - advantage: non shared GL settings
 -Reinhard tonemapper + Range tonemapper
 -VPT gc in shared session
 -M3D group of meshes vs single large mesh.
