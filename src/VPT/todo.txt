Marching cubes,
vpt frame background settings
volume sharing session.
garbage collect volumeTextures in Texture manager
parse scene cameras and replicate to VPT
load volume from server error - Vertebrah too big


Maybe:
 -Reuse VPT renderers instead of copies in /src/VPT/v_renderers.	-Maybe extend?
 -File loading menu, server files don't work
 -Angle issues - VPT shaders can't compile - undefined loop (at compile) in EAM render.frag
 	-MCS crash graphic driver(nvidia)
        -Artifacting with ISO, MIP in chrome, but not mozilla - maybe due to TriangleFans deprecated in dx10+
 -update bootstrap + alpha v colorpickerju

Rethink:
 -Depth		  ? export from VPT ! back culling disabled, near 0.0 for inside view =o
 -unlimited zoom  - scale cube? fov change? cut volume cube data to show layers !back culling disabled, near 0.0 for inside view =o
 -offscreeen canvas - advantage: non shared GL settings
 -Reinhard tonemapper
 -Range tonemapper


Consult :
 -primož, èemu background color  v vseh shaderjeeh, a lah izklopim. Tone mapper ?  Range mapper ?
